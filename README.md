# Gemini Nano Android Sample

An Android sample project for running **Gemini Nano** on-device.  
This project uses Android AICore and the [Google AI Edge SDK](https://ai.google.dev/edge) to demonstrate invoking the Gemini Nano model locally on the device.

## ‚ú® Gemini Nano Overview

- **Gemini Nano** is a lightweight model with limited capabilities compared to cloud-based Gemini models, but it enables ultra-low-latency inference on-device.  
- It is available on Pixel 9 series devices running Android 14 or higher, leveraging the AICore system service to keep the model up to date and minimize latency.  
- The AICore and Gemini Nano APIs are provided via the [Google AI Edge SDK](https://ai.google.dev/edge).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

1. Join the **[aicore-experimental Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/aicore-experimental)**
2. Enroll in the **[Android AICore beta testing program](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.aicore)**  
   > Once enrolled, the app name in the Play Store will change to `Android AICore (Beta)`
3. **Update the required apps on the Play Store**  
   - [Android AICore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.aicore): version must start with `0.thirdpartyeap`  
   - [Private Compute Services](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.as.oss): ensure version is `1.0.release.658389993` or higher

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Sign in to a Pixel 9 device that meets the above requirements with your beta tester account  
2. Build and run the sample project  
3. **Verify that the model is downloaded via the Download Manager**

## ‚ùó Notes and Caveats

- **This will not work on devices other than the Pixel 9 series**. References to Pixel 8 and Galaxy S24 from earlier documentation have been removed  
- If the same Google account is used across multiple devices, the AICore beta enrollment may conflict or fail to register  
- Real-world success cases:  
  - Registration failed with the existing account ‚Üí **Created a new Google account and registered on a single device ‚Üí Success**  
- Failure cases:  
  - After enrolling the existing Google account on Pixel 9 and updating AICore, the model failed to load
